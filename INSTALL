REQUIREMENTS

	   
  Gregarius requires a relatively up-to-date PHP installation (>= 4.3.0) 
  with xml (expat) support. It works fairly well with PHP5.
  
  Your PHP installation must support socket operations. See: 
  http://ch2.php.net/manual/en/function.fsockopen.php

  Additionally you will need access to a MySQL or a SQLite database.

QUICK START


    1.  If you are upgrading from an earlier version make sure you have a
	backup copy of all the files you have modified
        
    2.  If you haven't already done so, download the latest release from
	the sourceforge.net project site.
	http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=98845
   
    3.  Unpack the Gregarius package inside your web directory:
        
        1.  If you are installing from a tar.gz archive:

                tar xvfz rss-x.y.z.tar.gz
        
        2.  If you are installing from a zipped archive:

                unzip rss-x.y.z.zip
   
   4.   cd to the created directory:

            cd rss
 
   5.   Create a configuration file, based on the sample:
         
        1.  Copy the sample database configuration file:

                cp dbinit.php.sample dbinit.php
        
        2.  Edit the dbinit.php file to match your database configuration. 
            Make sure that the database user you define owns privileges to 
            create tables.
   
   6.   Point your browser to the root directory of your installation.
	You should read a message informing you that the database schema
	has been generated.

	If at this point, the browser returns a 500 internal server
	error, then remove (or disable) the .htaccess file in this
	directory and try again.

	mv .htaccess .htaccess.tmp

	See the FAQ http://wiki.gregarius.net/index.php/FAQ for more
	information.

	If the database user you defined lacks privileges to create
	database tables you should import your schema manually: from the
	command-line type (replacing database_user, database_host and
	database_name)
	
	php schema.php --dump > dbstruct.sql
        mysql -u database_user -h database_host -p database_name < dbstruct.sql
	
	
   7.   Point your browser to the URL corresponding the install
	location and click "Admin". After selecting a new password,
	you can start adding feeds by pasting URLs of RSS or RDF feeds
	into the "Add a feed" field. Alternatively you can import a
	list of feeds using the OPML import feature.
   
   8.   This version of Gregarius comes with default password
	protection, however you may wish to to strengthen it by using
	a .htaccess file. 
        
	See http://wiki.gregarius.net/index.php/Password_Protection
	for this purpose.
