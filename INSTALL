REQUIREMENTS

	   
  Gregarius requires a relatively up-to-date PHP installation (>= 4.3.0) 
  with xml (expat) support. It works fairly well with PHP5.
  
  Your PHP installation must support socket operations. See: 
  http://ch2.php.net/manual/en/function.fsockopen.php

  Additionally you will need access to a MySQL or a SQLite database.

QUICK START


    1.  If you are upgrading from an earlier version make sure you have a backup 
        copy of all the files you have modified
        
    2.  If you haven't already done so, download the latest release from the 
        sourceforge.net project site.

    3.  Unpack the Gregarius package inside your web directory:
        
        1.  If you are installing from a tar.gz archive:

                tar xvfz rss-x.y.z.tar.gz
        
        2.  If you are installing from a zipped archive:

                unzip rss-x.y.z.zip
   
   4.   cd to the created directory:

            cd rss
 
   5.   Create a configuration file, based on the sample:
         
        1.  Copy the sample database configuration file:

                cp dbinit.php.sample dbinit.php
        
        2.  Edit the dbinit.php file to match your database configuration. 
            Make sure that the database user you define owns privileges to 
            create tables.
   
   6.   Point your browser to the root directory of your installation. You should 
        read a message informing you that the database schema has been generated.

	If at this point, the browser returns a 500 internal server error, then 
	remove (or disable) the .htaccess file in this directory and try again.

	mv .htaccess .htaccess.tmp

	See the FAQ http://wiki.gregarius.net/index.php/FAQ for more information.

        If the database user you defined lacks privileges to create database 
        tables you should import your schema manually: from the command-line 
        type (replacing database_user, database_host and database_name)

        mysql -u database_user -h database_host -p database_name < dbstruct.sql

	
	
   7.   Point your browser to the URL corresponding the install location and 
        click "Admin". You can start adding feeds by pasting URLs of RSS or 
        RDF feeds into the "Add a feed" field. Alternatively you can import
        a whole structure of items using the OPML import feature.
   
   8.   You may wish to password-protect the administration section of your 
        fresh gregarius installation, to prevent unauthorized users from messing 
        with your subscriptions and breaking stuff. 
        
        See http://wiki.gregarius.net/index.php/Password_Protection
        for this purpose.
