REQUIREMENTS

	   
  Gregarius requires a relatively up-to-date PHP installation (>= 4.3.0) 
  with xml (expat) support. It works fairly well with the PHP5 pre-releases
  it has been tested with.

  Additionally you will need access to a MySQL database.

QUICK START

  1. Unpack the Gregarius package inside your web root:
     
     1.1 If you are installing from a tar.gz archive:
     
     	 tar xvfz rss-x.y.z.tar.gz 
     
     1.2 If you are installing from a zipped archive:
     
     	 unzip rss-x.y.z.zip
	 
  2. cd to the created directory:
  
     	cd rss-x.y.z
	
  3. Create a configuration file, based on the sample:
  
     3.1 Copy the sample database configuration file:
     
     	 cp dbinit.php.sample dbinit.php
     
     3.2 Edit the dbinit.php file to match your database 
     configuration
	
     3.3 Edit the main configuration file (config.php) to 
     suit your needs.
          
  4. Import the database structure:
  
     4.1 from the command-line:
       
       mysql -u database_user -h database_host -p database_name < dbstruct.sql
       
  
  5. Point your browser to the URL corresponding the install 
  location and click "Channel Admin". You can start adding channels 
  by pasting URLs of RSS or RDF feeds into the "Add a channel" 
  field. Alternatively you can import a whole structure of items 
  using the OPML import feature.
