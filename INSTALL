REQUIREMENTS

	   
  Gregarius requires a relatively up-to-date PHP installation (>= 4.3.0) 
  with xml (expat) support. It works fairly well with PHP5.
  
  Your PHP installation must support socket operations. See: 
  http://ch2.php.net/manual/en/function.fsockopen.php

  Additionally you will need access to a MySQL database.

QUICK START



   1. If you are upgrading from an earlier version make sure you have a
      backup copy of all the files you have modified.
   
   2. If you havent already done so, download the latest release from the
      sourceforge.net project site.

   3. Unpack the Gregarius package inside your web root:
	          
      3.1.  If you are installing from a tar.gz archive:
	  
	     tar xvfz rss-x.y.z.tar.gz
      
      3.2.  If you are installing from a zipped archive:

            unzip rss-x.y.z.zip
	       
   4. cd to the created directory:
		     
	    cd rss
			      
   5. Create a configuration file, based on the sample:
				             
      5.1.  Copy the sample database configuration file:

            cp dbinit.php.sample dbinit.php
	             
      5.2.  Edit the dbinit.php file to match your database configuration
   
   6. Import the database structure: from the command-line type:
	 
	    mysql -u database_user -h database_host -p database_name < dbstruct.sql

   7. Point your browser to the URL corresponding the install location
      and click Admin. You can start adding feeds by pasting 
      URLs of RSS or RDF feeds into the Add a feed field. 
      Alternatively you can import a whole structure of items using the 
      OPML import feature.
