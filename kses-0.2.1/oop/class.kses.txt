Parse($string = "")
   Performs the actual parsing of the HTML/HTML, removing
   tags and attributes that aren't allowed.

Protocols()
   Accepts either a string or an array of protocols, and
   calls $this->AddProtocol appropriately.  Protocols
   can optionally end in ":".

AddProtocol($protocol = "")
   Accepts a single string as a protocol and attempts to
   place it in the list of allowed protocols.  The protocol
   can optionally end in ":".

AddHTML($tag = "", $attribs = array())
   Accepts a string indicating an allowed tag, and a list
   of acceptable attributes for the specific tag, along
   with modifiers for that attribute. See the kses
   documentation for details.

   Additional calls to this method using the same tag will
   overwrite the existing tag definition.
