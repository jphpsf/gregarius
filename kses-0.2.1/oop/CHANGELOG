CHANGELOG

v 0.0.2
- Fixed a bug in AddProtocol that wasn't adding new protocols to
  $this->allowed_protocols

- Modified internal methods to correspond to kses 0.2.1 modifications.

- Created a basic test suite that can be run via web or CLI.

- Started CVSing the code.

v 0.0.1
- Turned all the kses_function_name functions to _function_name methods.

- Added a couple of properties (allowed_protocols, allowed_html) with
  $this->allowed_protocols defaulting to the lion's share of usual
  protocols.

- Modified the applicable use of preg_replace() functions to point to
  internal class methods.

- Reduced the parameter list of some methods since internal properties
  are now being used.

- Added "public" methods to set up the allowed protocols and HTML.
