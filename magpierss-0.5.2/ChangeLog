	* magpie_simple.php, rss_cache.inc, rss_fetch.inc, rss_parse.inc:
	MAJOR CLEANUP!
	
	* rss_fetch got rid of the options array, replaced it with a more
	PHP-like solution of using defines.  constants are setup, with
	defaults, in the function init()
	
	got rid of the idiom of passing back an array, its was awkward to
	deal with in PHP, and unusual (and consquently confusing to
	people).  now i return true/false values, and try to setup error
	string where appropiate (rss_cache has the most complete example of
	this)
	
	change the logic for interacting with the cache
	
	* rss_cache major re-working of how error are handled.	tried to
	make the code more resillient.	the cache is now much more aware of
	MAX_AGE, where before this was being driven out of rss_fetch (which
	was silly)
	
	* rss_parse properly handles xml parse errors.	used to sail along
	blithely unaware.
