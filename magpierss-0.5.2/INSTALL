REQUIREMENTS

	MapieRSS requires a recent PHP 4+ (developed with 4.2.0)
	with xml (expat) support
	
QUICK START

	Magpie can work "out of the box".  Usually nothing more then placing 4
	MagpieRSS include files (rss_fetch.inc, rss_parser.inc, rss_cache.inc, and
	rss_util.inc) in the same directory as your PHP script will be required.
	
	You might want to:
	
	* Add the include files to your include path.
	* Create a cache directory that your webserver can write to
	  (Mapie will try to create one for you, but it often fails)
	* Read through the constants at the top of rss_fetch.inc
	  see if there is anything you want to override (the defaults should
	  be pretty good)
